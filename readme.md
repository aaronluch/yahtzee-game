## Project Summary

### What does it do?

The Yahtzee Simulation Game is a text-based console application that recreates the classic dice game of Yahtzee. Players interact with the game through a series of text prompts and commands, allowing them to roll dice, choose dice to hold, and strategically select their scoring categories. The game includes features such as:

- Dice rolling simulation with the choice to re-roll specific dice.
- Hold mechanism to retain dice across rolls for strategic play.
- Scoring system following official Yahtzee rules.
- Score tracking to keep tabs on the player's game progress.
- End-of-game summary to show the final score and offer a replay option.

This game captures the essence of Yahtzee while providing an engaging text-based interface.

### Why did we build it?

This project was designed to encapsulate the core principles of object-oriented programming learned during the CS 110 course. It started as an exercise to implement a text-based game and evolved into a full-fledged simulation of Yahtzee, challenging us to apply our knowledge in a practical, fun, and interactive way. The project provided an opportunity to deepen our understanding of Java programming, problem-solving, and application design.

## Getting Started

To play the Yahtzee Simulation Game, you will need:

- A Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your computer.
- To compile the Java source files and run the main class.

Follow these steps to get started:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the `src` directory and compile the Java files using `javac *.java`.
3. Run the `GameDriver` class with `java GameDriver` to begin the game.
4. Follow the on-screen instructions to play the game.

## Technologies Used

- **Java**: The primary programming language used to implement the game logic, handle user input, and manage game state.
